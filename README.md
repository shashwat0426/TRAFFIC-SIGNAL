# TRAFFIC-DIGNAL
traffic signal using Arduino 

DEVICE USED- ARDUINO UNO, RED,GREEN,YELLOW LED, 7 SEGMENT DISPLAY, RESISTANCE

HERE I have written the code in arduino and after sucessful teating of the code the .hex file needed to be pasted in the properties of arduino uno in Proteus software.

While coding I have determined the time after which the led light changes, and after completing a cycle it continue to work in loop so that
we will write that code in VOID LOOP(in arduino) ; and output in void steup, and input is written in the begining.
